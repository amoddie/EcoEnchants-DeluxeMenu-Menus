# EcoEnchants Infomational Menus

The files listed in the repository include the DeluxeMenu config needed for the GUI Menu's, and each menu with enchantment descriptions included.
As I also use this menu for my game server, it will be regularly updated at my convenience as long as the game server & plugin exists.
These configurations will remain free to use, and can provide discord support when I am able to. (amoddie#8203)

The dependencies for these menus are DeluxeMenus & PlaceholderAPI
